I'm **Andrew**.  Data Scientist HEO in DSMT.  Started (in DSET) March 2021.  I work from home, **Leeds**.  I typically work **9:00-17:30**, but take advantage of flexitime for when I don't feel productive.  Easiest way to contact me is **Teams**, I like chat and calls.  PM to give me honest feedback, I'm trying to improve.

In DSMT I focus on the population simulation, GIS analysis, data access, software infrastructure (CDAP and SCE).  I like to work with Python if I get a choice, and a bit of a stickler for using git and linting.  I like to think, I follow Uncle Bob's Clean Code mantra: 'The only way to go fast, is to go well!'.  My personal goals working for Defra, are to help improve environmental policy and practice, while hoping a farming illiterate mathematician can support this.

My [16 personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) result is ISTP-A.  Which means... ðŸ¤·.  Maybe this implies reasons; why I'm a first choice presenter, why I dive deep into rabbit holes learning programming, or why I avoid reading.  Or why I created a [silly website](https://github.com/aw-west-defra/manuelof.me/blob/main/README.md) instead of working, or a [poetry website](https://consciouscontours.com/) while not working.
